To extract terms from a PDF file, match them with terms from the first CSV file, and then categorize them in another CSV file, you can use the `pdftools` and `tidyverse` packages in R. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Install and load the required libraries if you haven't already:

```R
install.packages("pdftools")
library(pdftools)
library(tidyverse)
```

2. Read the PDF file and extract its text content:

```R
pdf_file <- "your_pdf_file.pdf"  # Replace with the path to your PDF file
pdf_text <- pdf_text(pdf_file)
pdf_text <- paste(pdf_text, collapse = "\n")
```

3. Read the first CSV file with Drug Class and Drug Action data:

```R
drug_class_df <- read.csv("drug_class.csv")  # Replace with the actual path to your CSV file
```

4. Tokenize the text from the PDF file using `tidytext`:

```R
pdf_tokens <- data_frame(text = pdf_text) %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text)
```

5. Match the terms from the PDF file with the terms in the Drug Class column of the CSV file:

```R
matched_terms <- pdf_tokens %>%
  semi_join(drug_class_df, by = c("word" = "Drug Class")) %>%
  select(word)
```

6. Categorize the matched terms by joining them with the Drug Action from the CSV file, and create a new data frame:

```R
categorized_terms <- matched_terms %>%
  left_join(drug_class_df, by = c("word" = "Drug Class")) %>%
  select("word", "Drug Action")

# Rename the columns if needed
colnames(categorized_terms) <- c("Matched Term", "Drug Action")
```

7. Write the categorized terms to a new CSV file:

```R
write.csv(categorized_terms, "categorized_terms.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

This code reads the PDF file, extracts text, tokenizes it, and matches the terms with the Drug Class column from the CSV file. It then categorizes the matched terms by appending the corresponding Drug Action and saves the results in a new CSV file named "categorized_terms.csv." Make sure to replace `"your_pdf_file.pdf"` and `"drug_class.csv"` with the actual file paths for your PDF and CSV files, respectively.
